            How did written records across civilizations construct and sustain the existence of gods in ways oral traditions could not?

        <div class="fade">
            Oral storytelling allows myths to evolve and adapt over time, with details shifting depending on the storyteller, the audience, or the cultural moment in which they are told. This fluidity can reshape how gods are perceived, altering their attributes, deeds, or even their importance within a pantheon. In contrast, written records establish fixed names, roles, and genealogies, preserving specific versions of myths that remain consistent across generations. This permanence makes deities appear more stable and authoritative, anchoring their identity in a way oral traditions could not.

                As the chief god of Babylon in Mesopotamian mythology, Marduk rose to prominence in the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation epic, where he defeated the primordial chaos dragon Tiamat and used her body to form the heavens and earth. After this victory, he was proclaimed "King of the gods", associated with justice, order, and creation.

As a god of creation, justice, and kingship, he symbolized authority and stability, reflecting the political and religious dominance of Babylon itself. His myth, the Enuma Elish, portrays him as a decisive and powerful deity whose triumph shaped both the heavens and the human world.</h1>

                He ordained the year and into sections he divided it;
                For the twelve months he fixed three stars.

                He made strong the bolt on the left and on the right.

                The Moon-god he caused to shine forth, the night he entrusted to him.
                He appointed him, a being of the night, to determine the days;
                Every month without ceasing with the crown he covered him, saying:
                "At the beginning of the month, when thou shinest upon the land,
                Thou commandest the horns to determine six days,
                And on the seventh day to divide the crown.
                On the fourteenth day thou shalt stand opposite, the half....

            Across Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, written records did more than preserve stories, they anchored divine identities into cultural, political, and religious structures. Oral traditions allowed gods to shift with each storyteller, but writing gave them stable names, relationships, and their roles became fixed, enduring across multiple generations. By inscribing myths into tablets, scrolls, and manuscripts, civilizations not only sustained belief in their gods but also used these records to reinforce authority, unify communities, and shape cultural memory. Writing transformed gods from fluid figures of spoken narrative into enduring pillars of civilization, ensuring their presence long after the voices of oral tradition faded.
